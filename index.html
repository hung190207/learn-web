          <h2>My Career So Far</h2>

          <p>
            Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean starts-ups and was
            a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator,
            the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked
            my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw
            the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently, I lead UI/UX
            design at SaaS start-up VideoMyJob.
